# SubjectSkirmish
We are making a pokemon-inspired, 2D game in which a player navigates the map, encountering creatures and accumulating items.
We hope to reach a point in our coding where anyone can design a creature and easily incorporate them into the game. In order to play the game, it is helpful to know the controls. The d-pad is used to move the player around the board. Clicking "M" opens the menu, which is navigated with space or enter (used interchangeably) to select a button and "B" to return to the previous display screen (unless the continue option is available). Moving through doors will lead to new randomly generated maps. There is currently no way to return to a previous map. If you are for any reason trapped, pressing "R" will refresh the screen with a new board so that you may continue your adventure. Enjoy!
